# adapt-navigationLogo

**Navigation Logo** is an *extension* for displaying an image in the course navigation bar.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/898168/210416404-8118fd76-83eb-48d1-8cf1-36c7724bb7dd.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500">

## Settings overview

The image displays with minimal padding by default or can be configured to fill the navigation bar height. For mobile, an alternative, mobile-friendly image can be specified or the logo can be hidden entirely. The logo can be shown on the menu, on specific pages, or everywhere as default.

## Attributes

The following attributes are set within *course.json*.

The object that defines the content to render. It contains the following settings:

#### **\_isEnabled** (boolean)

#### **\_isHiddenOnMenu** (boolean)

When `true`, hides the logo on the main menu. Default: `false`

#### **\_graphic** (object)

The graphic object that defines the image which is rendered. The assumed use case for this image is to display a client's logo. It contains the following settings:

#### **_routeToLocation** (string)

When set to a valid Adapt element, the logo image will link to the specified location. Valid values include a page (e.g. `co-100`) or a menu (e.g. `course`). `@course` can used to always returns to the main menu of the course.

Default: `false` where the image is displayed with minimal padding. Set to `true` for the image to fill the nav bar height.
